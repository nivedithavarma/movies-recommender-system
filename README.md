# movies-recommender-system

## Description:
This project implements a movie recommender system that suggests similar movies based on the content of the selected movie. The system utilizes content-based recommendation techniques to recommend movies that share similar features or characteristics with the one chosen by the user.

# Components:

# Streamlit Web App:

The user interface is created using Streamlit, allowing users to interact with the recommender system through a web browser.


# Movie Data: 

The system relies on a dataset of movies, which includes information such as movie titles, IDs, genres, and possibly other metadata.


# Recommendation Engine: 


The recommendation logic is based on the content similarity between movies. It analyzes the features of the selected movie, such as its genre, and recommends movies with similar features.


# Movie Poster API: 

The system retrieves movie posters dynamically using The Movie Database (TMDb) API based on the movie IDs.

# Functionality:

Users can select a movie from a dropdown list of available movies.
Upon selecting a movie and clicking the "Recommend" button, the system displays a list of recommended movies along with their posters.
The recommendations are based on the content similarity between the selected movie and other movies in the dataset, such as shared genres.

# Technologies Used:

# Python: 

The primary programming language used for building the application logic.


# Streamlit: 

Used for creating the web application and user interface.


# Pandas: 


Utilized for data manipulation and handling movie data.


# Requests: 

Used for making HTTP requests to fetch movie posters from TMDb API.


# Pickle: 

Used for serializing and deserializing Python objects such as movie data and similarity matrices.

Overall, this project provides a content-based movie recommender system that allows users to discover movies based on their content similarities, such as shared genres or themes.
